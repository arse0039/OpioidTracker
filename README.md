This is an application meant to inform the user on the opioid epidemic in American. This dashboard uses Dash, Pandas, and various API's to display data in graph form regarding opioid prescription rate changes, opioid fatal overdose events, and opioid non-fatal overdose events via state and county entered by the user.

This application also informs the user on various medication alternatives, therapeutic alternatives, and national resources.

The application can be launched in powershell or the command line via python app.py

Below is a GIF of the application in action on my local host!
